### Mission

Create a community to share GIS solutions for environmental protection.

The core of the community will be to collect, organize methods and operational tools, to be disseminated all over the world through communication activities.

### Introduction

I started 10 years ago with GISTIPS ... and now I open GIS Tips Academy aka GTA-00.

**GISTIPS** project, which has evolved over the last 10 years, is currently focused on the following 3 aspects:

* an open-source webgis platform, completely customizable called **watchdog**
* geohash and openstreetmap integration (proof-of-location)
* arrangement of **geospatial-data-catalog**

More about >> [watchdog](https://github.com/piergiorgio-roveda/wp-watchdog-public)

I have never learned so much since I started sharing ... and I will do it forever!

I'm Piergiorgio and I'm an Urban planner with experiences in GIS (Geographic information systems).

The GIS software program is a great benefit in the workplace and you can use it:

* for creating map
* for analyzing geographic data
* for publishing some maps on your website

GIS isn't simple to understand, because it's a merged solution between Excel, Photoshop, Illustrator and CAD software.

I created a YouTube channel in 2012 about GIS and QGIS with more than 500 tutorials for free. Please share these video!

I'm PJ, founder of Cityplanner.

Happy mapping!

#### Why there is 00 suffix?

I hope that someone start parallel GIS Tips Academy with GTA-01 and many other follow this example.

### Rules

1. All contents in Academy are free to use and open source
2. No one can ask for personal information on behalf of the Academy, but all can place name or nickname everywhere
3. The official language will be English
4. The contents will always refer to maps, GIS and geolocation

### A single reference

For many reasons, the only support reference is this email [lima.cityplanner@gmail.com](mailto:lima.cityplanner@gmail.com) which is my personal email. I am the only person who can read it and there will never be third parties who can access this email. Regarding the published content, each author can decide whether to publish his own reference or remain anonymous.

### Collaboration

I'm @Pj Hooker and I'm an author. I invite anyone to become an author like me. The authors will become students of the academy. To become a student it is possible to follow one of the paths described in the [dedicated section](https://github.com/piergiorgio-roveda/gistips-academy/blob/main/faq/become-a-student.md).
