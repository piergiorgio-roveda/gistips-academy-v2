# GISTIPS-Academy (GTA)

## Description

**I want this community to grow.**

GTA is a community of users about methods and operational tools for environmental protection, geospatial technologies and everything awesome around it. Members of this community are commonly (but not limited to being) cartographers, geographic information system (GIS) professionals, surveyors, scientists, academics, those whose work has a geographic component and some robots. The power of the community is knowledge. Any obstacle to this knowledge will put an end to this community. The 2 words GIS + TIPS, are in common use. Anyone can become a member, be part of the organizational structure, clone this community.

## Welcome

This is a community-driven called GISTIPS-Academy aka GTA and you are free to join. This community started in 2010, but what you are seeing is the new version that started in 2021. There is no link to the old versions, but knowledge remains. Did you know that Geospatial revolutions started in 2020? The community's goal is to be part of this revolution. Welcome on board.

## Mission

{% hint style="danger" %}
This list is a draft. The implementation of the complete rules is underway and will be proposed to the community in the form of a vote.
