# ðŸ¤” Concept

I started 10 years ago with GISTIPS ... and now I open GIS Tips Academy aka GTA-00.

## Community-driven academy

## Topics

The contents will always refer to maps, GIS and geolocation

## Collect, organize methods and operational tools

## Dissemination all over the world through communication activities

## Community without cost

I have never learned so much since I started sharing ... and I will do it forever!

I'm Piergiorgio and I'm an Urban planner with experiences in GIS (Geographic information systems).

The GIS software program is a great benefit in the workplace and you can use it:

* for creating map
* for analyzing geographic data
* for publishing some maps on your website

GIS isn't simple to understand, because it's a merged solution between Excel, Photoshop, Illustrator and CAD software.

I created a YouTube channel in 2012 about GIS and QGIS with more than 500 tutorials for free. Please share these video!

I'm PJ, founder of Cityplanner.

Happy mapping!
